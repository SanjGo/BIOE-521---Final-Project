## Weight Activated Temperature Sensing Coaster

This project utilizes Circuit Playground to detect temperatures of an object placed on top of it.
There are three components involved: 
1) Pressure sensor triggering of code
2) Temperature readings outputted in Fahrenheit and plotted over time
3) Dual color palettes LEDs (one for users that may have colorblindness) to indicate different temperature ranges predetermined by the user
